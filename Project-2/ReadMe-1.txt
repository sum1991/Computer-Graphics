REQUIREMENTS:
Complete all levels.
	Done!
	Lv1> I used splines for the coaster.
	Lv2> I added ground from Project 1.
	Lv3> I used a sky-box for the sky.
	Lv4> I made a roller coaster.
	Lv5> I made it more than just a line.
	
Properly render Catmull-Rom splines to represent your track.
	Done!
	I did use catmull-rom splines for the track.
	
Render a texture-mapped ground and sky.
	Done!
	I used the ground from Assignment 1, and a sky-box.
	
Render a rail cross-section.
	Done!
	I made the rail more than just a line.
	
Move the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path and orientation along the coaster.
	Done!
	The camera follows the coaster as it moves along the track.
	
Render the coaster in an interesting manner (good visibility, realism).
	Done!
	It looks pretty cool.
	
Run at interactive frame rates (>15fps at 640x480)
	Done!
	I ran at >15FPS
	
Be reasonably commented and written in an understandable manner--we will read your code.
	Done!
	My code is all in one file, but it is well commented. Should be fairly understandable.
	
Be submitted along with JPEG frames for the required animation (see below).
	Done!
	I have included the JPEG frames and the video in the submission. images are in assign2/record folder. video is in assign2 folder
	
Be submitted along with a readme file documenting your program's features and describing the approaches you took to each of the open-ended problems we posed here (rendering the sky and determining coaster normals in particular). This is especially crucial if you have done something spectacular for which you wish to receive extra credit!
	Done!
	This is this document.
	
EXTRA CREDIT:
Render a T-shaped rail cross-section.
(Maybe? I don't know what a T-rail cross-section is, but my coaster looks pretty awesome.)

Render double rail (like in real railroad tracks).
Done! This I definately did. It looks like train tracks.

Make your track circular and close it with C1 continuity (small credit, i.e., 1 point).
Done! My track loops over and over and over and ... and over.

Draw additional scene elements: texture-mapped wooden crossbars, a support structure that looks realistic, decorations on your track, something interesting in the world nearby, etc.
Done! Textured wooden crossbars, and a realistic support structure.

Render the environment in a better (prettier, more efficient, more interesting, etc?) manner than described here.
Done! I made the sky-box seamless, and did not use a flat ground. Also, I used DisplayLists for a more efficient rendering.

Modify the velocity with which your camera moves to make it physically realistic in terms of gravity. Please see the [equation] on how to update u for every time step.
Done! The coaster moves with "gravity", I fudged the gravity constant a bit, and no friction was used, but it is in space so...
