Program Requirements: (All complete)
•Handle at least a 256x256 image for your height field at interactive frame rates (window size of 640x480). Height field manipulations should run smoothly.
•Be able to render the height field as points, lines("wireframe"), or solid triangles (with keys for the user to switch between the three).
•Render as a perspective view, utilizing GL's depth buffer for hidden surface removal.
•Use input from the mouse to spin the heightfield around using glRotate.
•Use input from the mouse to move the heightfield around using glTranslate.
•Use input from the mouse to change the dimensions of the heightfield using glScale.
•Color the vertices using some smooth gradient.
•Be reasonably commented and written in an understandable manner--we will read your code.
•Be submitted along with JPEG frames for the required animation (see below).
•Be submitted along with a readme file documenting your program's features, describing any extra credit you have done, and anything else that you may want to bring to our attention.

Extras:
•Live model switching using arrow keys
•Textured model from another image
